## 📖 What's Inside?
This project focuses on three core concepts that are often difficult to visualize in 2D:
1. **Angle between a Line and a Plane:** Visualizing the orthogonal projection.
2. **Angle between Two Planes:** Understanding the dihedral angle.
3. **Theorem of Three Perpendiculars:** A step-by-step breakdown of the relationship between perpendicular lines in 3D space.

## 🛠️ Built With
